# Patient-priority-Queue

Program being tested: EmergencyQueueTest.java

Objectives: The objective was to make an interface for an emergency room to help mange the line. The interface can add patients, remove treated patients list patients and find the next patient by their priority number.

Requirements: 
-A Computer 
-A java work Place (ie. DoctorJava,  Eclipse)
- EmergencyQueueTest.java
-Queue.java
Testing: 
To test this program simply load Queue.java and EmergencyQueueTest.java in to a java work space. Then compile and run the program and an interface will display the instruction and different options.

Risks: 
Some bug that I found with this program is that the remove and list functions can sometimes lose the list and overwrite the queue

Conclusion: 
In conclusion this could be a handy tool for keeping a line organized by severity or by priority. As well as tracking information like how many people are in the waiting room or how many people have been treated throughout the day.
